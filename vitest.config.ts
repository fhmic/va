/**
 * CTO Review Foundation Hardening — Change #7: Foundation Testing.
 *
 * Vitest was already a devDependency (package.json) but had no config
 * and no tests — this is the first real config for it. `@/*` alias
 * mirrors tsconfig.json's `paths` mapping; Vitest doesn't read tsconfig
 * paths on its own without an extra plugin, so it's declared explicitly
 * here instead of adding a new dependency for one alias.
